### Who am I?
Hi, my name is Nezha, I recent masters graduate from [Ibn Zahor University](https://www.uiz.ac.ma/), Morocco. I live in Agadhir, a city of vast historical attachment, with my parents and love to travel around the world.

### Why create this?

**Reason #1:** I wanted to show the world what I am doing in career. I believe sharing is caring, and we can make a better world by sharing our knowledge.

**Reason #2:** I wanted to learn how a student from Biology background can also set up her own website.
